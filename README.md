# Reddit_Persona_Generator

A Python project that scrapes public Reddit user data (posts and comments) and uses a local open-source language model (flan-t5-large) to generate a psychological persona for that user.

## Features
 Scrapes up to 50 Reddit posts and 50 comments from a public Reddit user

 Uses a locally run HuggingFace model (distilgpt2) to generate the user's persona

 Works fully offline (after initial model download)

 Outputs structured data with insights like:

Name, Age, Occupation

Behaviors, Goals, Frustrations

Archetype, Tier, Motivations, Personality

Yes. Once the HuggingFace model is downloaded, everything works offline.
