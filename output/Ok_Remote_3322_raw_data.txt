Title: Lets not forget this guy Happy bday DDP
Body: Tbh never thought he would be this impactful when we bought him . He is a local boy and his love for performing for RCB can be seen the way he plays. He may be having serious health issues that always disrupt his career inbetween ( he is suffering from a chronic disease). This disease has make him lose wt, become weak, and lose his power game too. 

But the way he batted everytime he was in the middle was so inspiring and his partnerships with koach, was so beautiful to see. Glad he was there in Ahemdabad when we won.

Hope he recovers soon . DDP ‚ù§Ô∏è

Title: Raw emotions of Kohli during the last 2 overs
Body: I wanna be R. dar or Swastik chikara üò≠. Great win, needed to be good in last few overs. Hope we get to learn and adapt to planB in pressure situations. KP and suyash bowled too well ,built the pressure in overs 10-15. Gave us something to fight on in last few overs. Then hoff did goat stuff, bhuvi although just ruined the match i though at that moment, hoff again came back with 2 wkt and single run 19th over.

Title: Green scores 100 on his return to cricket after injury We need to get him back
Body: Green has joined Gloucestershire for five four-day red-ball matches, concluding in late May, as he builds his match fitness with a view to playing for Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord's in June.

Green came to crease with his team reeling at 41/3. Scored a brilliant hundred on his comeback.

Though, retired hurt after a single, he told they were just cramps.

We need to get Greeny back, played amazingly well but was under rated tbh. 

His bowling was so crucial in many matches. With Livi not performing we need a solid option of Green

Title: Navdeep Saini on how he can't forget his time with RCB
Body: Navdeep Saini was with us for  four  seasons. Waching his growth with RCB was truly special ‚Äî he made his India debut while proudly wearing the RCB jersey.  
His last season with us was 2021, after which he moved to Rajasthan Royals.  
The ultimate highlight? That unforgettable Super Over against MI in 2021 ‚Äî Saini bowling fire yorkers to  Pollard, Hardik, and Rohit, literally sealing the win for us.  
Sheer character, raw pace, and heart ‚Äî thank you for the memories, Navdeep. Once an RCBian, always an RCBian. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Title: Got this for 1949/ (Mango flavor)
Body: So I was actively looking for a good mango flavored whey protein (since it's summer). 
The muscleblaze bioenzyme whey was always around 2600 on zepto/swiggy/amazon.
While scrolling zepto  2 days back came across this refill packaging . (Out of stock frkm now ) Costed me 1949. I had never seen this packing from MB ,so had to confirm its assured before ordering.

The taste is good. It like mango pulp flavor. Not much artificial aftertaste. 

I had this in 2 ways: 

1. Curd and whey topped with fruits , seeds.

2. Milk, whey and fruits blended together.

I'd recommend this flavor: Magical mango ( 1kg packing )

Title: We've got a diamond in RaPa !!!
Body: Not just his batting man , but the way he carries himself. Leading our team like a calm headed guy.

Such great tactical moves today. 

1. Bowling bhuvi 3 over in pp
2. Swapnil against Dube (despite the wrong match up, trusting on suyash)
3. Letting livi bowl his full qouta
4. Bringing yash for 3rd over to kill the match.
(Bowled rachin and  dube )

And talking about his batting , justifying why rcb fans rate him so high. Get that 500 runs season RaPa.  We are all behind u . 
We want u to play for india too.

Title: 21M , 99kg to 70kg, 3yr Progress
Body: Sharing this transformation not because I‚Äôve "made it," but because I‚Äôm still on the journey. This is a mirror pic taken at the same spot, 3 years apart. Looking back, I started with zero knowledge about diet and training‚Äîjust trial and error, figuring things out as I went.

At first, I only focused on cardio, thinking that was the way to get fit. Strength training wasn‚Äôt even on my mind. But as I learned more from Jeff Nippard, Jeremy Ethier, and Dr. Mike, I realized how important muscle-building and diet are. That‚Äôs when things changed.

Right now, I eat at ~2100 calories with ~130g of protein, maintaining my weight while focusing on building muscle and getting leaner. 

My workout split:

Day 1:  chest and shoulders

Day 2: back and rear delts

Day 3: Arms 

Day 4: Lower Body


Recently, I also started taking ab training seriously and working on developing my core.


Even after this progress, I still feel insecure about the loose skin on my chest and lower belly. Sometimes, it makes me feel like I haven‚Äôt done enough. 

I‚Äôm not claiming an insane transformation, but I‚Äôve come a long way. The goal? To keep pushing

Body: I know most BBL performers don't end up replicating their performances in the IPL.

But still which player would u want playing for us .

Personally, 

* I felt Nikhil chaudhary (Hobart) is a handy player
* Cooper connolly is a bright talent , but is more of a anchor but gives bowling option too.
* Mitch Owen is a another great all rounder in Aus circuit
* ben dwarshius is a lefty pacer + handy hitter at back end.
* Lloyd Pope is a genuine good leggie.

Title: Amazon DA scammed me, CS refuses to refund
Body: TDLR ; phone not received, marked as delivered, Amz refused to refund, Fk u amazon

I ordered a phone for my mother online from amz on 28th Dec . It was worth 11K and i did online  payment as COD wasn't available. 

On the date of delivery (29th), I received an OTP, which should have been provided only after I received the product. However, the delivery was marked as delivered merely two minutes after I missed the delivery agent's (DA) call. I was not provided with the DA‚Äôs contact details or the PIN required to call them back.

The customer service agents attempted to contact the DA on the same day, but their calls were either unanswered or busy, further adding to the ambiguity of the situation. They asked me to wait 24hrs.

I contacted again after that they told me investigation would take place and I would get refund on 4th. So when I called them on 4th they told me that product has been delivered and no refund would take place.

Despite repeated calls, they continue denying me to atleast provide DA or Hub's details.

I checked with neighbours too, but for no avail. Ig the DA never came, but they(C.S) kept blaming me that I was the one who gave him OTP as it's not possible to complete delivery without it.

However, yesterday when I contacted them again , some agent Priyanka conveyed that certain packages can be delivered without OTPs, including my order. This raises serious questions about Amz security practices, as it undermines the purpose of OTP verification.

Idk about you guyz, but I wouldn't be ordering from this platform again and not renewing my prime membership. Fk u amazon.

Body: TDLR ; phone not received, marked as delivered, Amz refused to refund

I ordered a phone for my mother online from amz on 28th Dec . It was worth 11K and i did upi payment as COD wasn't available. ( I live near Sfd Enclave , so it's never tough to find my address as the main road is merely few meters away)

Despite repeated calls, they continue denying me to atleast provide DA or Hub's details.

I checked the tracking updates and it was out for delivery from Noida around 8:35 am and marked delivered at 10:02am ( I live in South Delhi )

I checked with neighbours too, but for no avail. Ig the DA never came, but they(C.S) kept blaming me that I was the one who gave him OTP as it's not possible to complete delivery without it.

Title: how to proceed legally Against Amazon ?
Body: I ordered a Phone from Amazon on Dec 28, scheduled for delivery on Dec 29. The delivery was marked as ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù two minutes after I missed the agent‚Äôs call. I never received the product and couldn‚Äôt contact the delivery agent due to not receiving the necessary PIN.

After multiple follow-ups, Amazon assured me an investigation would be done and a resolution would be provided by Jan 4. Today, they refused a refund or replacement, claiming the order was delivered.

I‚Äôm a Prime member for 3 years and feel this issue hasn‚Äôt been handled properly.

# What legal options do I have?

* Filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline?
* Taking this to Consumer Court or Small Claims Court?

Any advice on how to proceed legally would be appreciated!


Update : guys it got refunded . After all failing attempts of mailing and calling Amazon cs. 
I registered FIR and prepared a legal notice.  
I received a mail from Amazon 3 days after mailing them legal notice about how they have initiated the refund and apologized as well.
So after all this mental trauma , finally got it.  From now on doing COD from big amt orders

Comment: Ig this is how i'd have to wait for getting even a glimpse of virat till the next IPL. 

I really thought he had good 2 years of cricket left in him. Left the tests. Even ODI, Idk if GG would allow him to for the WC'27 since there is hardly any other cricket for virat in next few years. üò≠

Comment: Things i took granted for like vk winning games for us, yeah i would see him in next match, next series, its just a rest. But then u realize , there is no next match or series, and all i have is memories of him being, playing out sessions, hyping fast bowlers, in face of opposition. Who knew the first time i saw him in stadium in Delhi ranji game would also be the the last time i would see him in whites.

Comment: its to target diff niche of people. People who focus just on protein (isolate, need no extra carbs etc), others those who happy with a little less protein(concentrate), others who need just source of carbs and protein (beginners)

Comment: Just coincidence, nothing else. This doesn't prove that  we don't need bumrah. Like in the case of pant, who's overseas centuries haven't come in a win. This doesn't downgrade all the things he has done for us.
